The provided REST API allows owners to automatically update their **spaces**.

**Example use case:**

Someone who wants to display availability in their parking lot can set up parking sensors and use the API to automatically update the corresponding object in their grid to show which parking spots are occupied.

&nbsp;

## Authentication

Each user has an Secret API Key to control the **spaces** that they own. This key is needed to make API calls. Your API Key can be found in your account page. Do not share your secret API Keys, if you think your API has been compromised, you can generate a new one.

```bash
$ curl "{API_URL}/api/v1/ping" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer {API KEY}"
```

```json
// Response
{ "message": "pong" }
```
